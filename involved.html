In addition, we have a variety of fun events we host for students, such as destressing events and free breakfast. Every month, we have a general meeting which is open to all students which serves as a great way to meet the officers and learn more about the SWE community.

              The public relations committee helps keep everyone informed about SWE’s events and opportunities. Members of the committee will be helping with the weekly SWEmail, Facebook events and covers, flyers, and organizing design workshops. Consider joining the public relations committee if you have an interest in design, communications, or anything public relations related! Experience with Illustrator or other relevant tools is preferred but not at all required.

Mentorship hosts both the professional Mentorship and the SWEster program, and thus committee members will be responsible for managing the logistics, publicity, and personal relations of each event. You'll be emailing dozens of professional women in the Bay Area, and this is a fantastic opportunity to expand your network and learn more about what engineering looks like from your peers and beyond.

              Team Tech is a national competition run by SWE and sponsored by Boeing in which a team at school works with an industry partner on a project. The company and project is of each team’s choosing. Teams are evaluated both on the end product quality and the ability of the team to work together. Project proposals may be submitted during the fall semester after which teams may begin their work. The final report is due at the end of the spring semester, and the presentations occur at the SWE fall conference.

              Do you want an opportunity to get more involved in SWE by giving back to its members? Being an apprentice for the social committee allows you the opportunity to foster a stress-free environment, with guaranteed laughter and smiles. Help coordinate fun activities with the Membership Director. It is a great stepping stone into becoming a more active SWEster and be able to see a behind-the-scene glimpse in the planning process.

              The Intersocietal Apprentice will help the Intersocietal Chair organize and implement creative social events for SWE and between other engineering organizations. The Intersocietal Apprentice and Intersocietal Chair will work together to foster an attitude of communal growth and work to maintain SWE’s social presence in the engineering community. Some events that the apprentice will be responsible for planning with the Chair will include the Professor’s Lunch, an intersocietal trivia night, and other fun intersocietal events, such as a potential DIY Boba Bar!  This apprenticeship will be a great way to obtain invaluable event planning experience, while having fun and meeting fellow engineers, as well!

              Mini-University is a free one-day event on March 15th designed to encourage underserved bay-area 9th-11th grade students to pursue careers in STEM and is open to all genders. As a volunteer you will be leading students on lab tours, helping with hands-on engineering activities, and sharing your engineering experiences with the high schoolers. If you are interested in helping out with a specific component such as through a 15 minute lightning talk, student panel, or have other ideas for how you would like to help out (ex. activity ideas or labs we could tour), join the Mini-U committee!

              SWE Outreach organizes a variety of STEM activities and events for K-5 students, including two primary programs – Science Saturdays and the Parent Education Program. Science Saturdays is a program offered to 4th and 5th grade students that provides them with a great opportunity to develop their intellectual curiosities through creative projects and find out more about what it’s like to be an engineer. The Parent Education Program seeks to provide parents with more resources and information on how to support their child’s pursuit of STEM. Outreach is also involved in organizing and/or attending many other events on campus or at local K-12 Schools that help promote STEM education to more diverse groups of young students.

              HSEP (High School Engineering Program) works to enrich high school students' understanding and range of experience with different engineering disciplines, and inspire them to continue to pursue STEM in whatever capacity that suits them. This program runs for 10 weeks on Saturdays from 10AM to 1PM. Mentors are expected to be there half an hour before and after the start of the program for set up and clean up.

              SWE++ is a 10 week course that aims to provide introductory programming skills to 30 local middle girls. The first 9 weeks covers an interactive curriculum in Scratch and Python that our teachers and volunteers create and teach. The final week of the course is a full day of coding and engineer workshops called Code Day. Unlike the previous 9 weeks, Code Day is open to up to 100 girls in the area, allowing more girls access to a hands-on experience with technology.

              Engineering Day is a fun event in October for K-3rd graders. There will be numerous booths featuring different hands-on activities that the students are able to try out for themselves. It is a fun opportunity for students to explore science and engineering concepts with a fun Halloween theme! Around 100 students are expected, as well as their chaperones, and they’ll be able to wander around, trying out the different activities in a casual, carnival style.
