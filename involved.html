              The Overnight Host Program Committee (OHP) is responsible for overseeing two, single day-long events (one online and one in-person) prior to CalDay that gives incoming non-male engineers their first experience as UC Berkeley Engineer. Responsibilities range from inviting professors to events, matching pen pals between admitted and current engineering students, designing admit packages to be shipped and organizing online and in-person activities for incoming admits! This is a wonderful opportunity if you have been positively affected by OHP yourself and/or are looking for a way to give back to the community that made you feel a part of the College of Engineering during your freshman year. We look forward to meeting you and working with you as part of the SWE OHP committee.

             dinner from 6:00-8:30 pm on Wednesday, October 9th. EWI is the perfect place to search for an internship or

                break in the middle (date TBD). Mentors will begin working with us around the 3-week mark (September 20th) 
                and come in during sessions at the 5-week mark (October 11th) to help lead a technical project of their 
                choice with a group of 4-6 high school students. 

                <br><br>
                The technical project will be designed and facilitated by mentors, with the final few sessions of HSEP
                being dedicated to working on the project and preparing for the Final Showcase. This is a great chance
                for you to educate high school students on your field or academic interests. You'll be in charge of
                splitting up the work, guiding students through the process, and generally stepping into a mentor role.
                There are no creative limitations, and we will work with you to make sure your vision for the project
                can become a reality.

                <br><br>If you join our committee as a mentor, you will be able to:
                <br> > Design an educational project you're passionate about
                <br> > Mentor high school students on a personal level through a smaller group 
                <br> > Gain leadership experience by guiding students through the project you designed

                <br><br>
                In addition, no experience is necessary at all! If you have any questions, please reach out to the email above!

                    SWE++ is a 10-week program introducing Python programming to girls and nonbinary middle school students
                    which will be hosted every Saturday morning from 10 am-12 pm (committee members will be expected to arrive
                    by 9:45 am) in person at UC Berkeley campus starting from September 13th and ending on November 15th. As a 
                    committee member, you may be reaching out to other schools to help expand our program, help run logistics
                    within the Berkeley program, teach the students, help plan our end-of-the-semester event, and much more! 
                    We'll also be having committee socials throughout the semester so if you're looking to get to know more fellow 
                    SWE members as well as gain leadership/teaching experience this is a committee for you!

              Tech Day is a day-long conference on April 6th, 2024 from 9 am to 2 pm for middle school female and non-binary identifying students to gain more exposure to Computer Science and technology. Students are encouraged to showcase their projects during the conference. And, there will be hands-on workshops in both hardware and software, engaging STEM and career panels, as well as ample opportunities for students to bond with each other as well as get to know current UC Berkeley STEM students. <br>
              As a committee member, you will be contributing to event planning and have the autonomy to implement your ideas! Some responsibilities as a committee member include: <br>
              > Plan and host workshops/activities during the conference. <br>
              > Host office hours and project workshops for middle school students. <br>

                Engineering Day is a Halloween-themed carnival-style event designed to encourage young elementary school
                children (K - 3rd grade) in the Bay Area to learn about STEM and participate in various themed booth
                activities. Our one-day program will take place on November 8th from 10 AM to 12 PM. Attendees will have
                the opportunity to complete hands-on STEM experiments, talk to “real” engineers, participate in
                lightning talks, and have fun with some arts and crafts!
                <br><br>
                There will be lots of creativity involved with making our activities as Halloween-themed as possible, so 
                meetings will be filled with a lot of fun - I can just feel it in my bones (get it)! No previous outreach or 
                STEM experience is needed, just enthusiasm for working with young children. Feel free to reach out with any questions!
