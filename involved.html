      <p class="text-center">For students, the best way to get involved in SWE at UC Berkeley is to become a general member, join a committee, or become an apprentice. In addition, we have a variety of social and professional events we host for students, as well as volunteering opportunities. Every month, we have a general meeting which is open to all students which serves as a great way to meet the officers and learn more about the SWE community. Officer positions open at the end of each semester for those who are interested in applying.</p>

      <p class="text-center"> If you would like to join one of SWE's committees, check back in at the beginning of the semester for committee applications. Applications will be released after the first general meeting of the semester, which is Thursday, September 9th from 6-7pm in 290 Hearst Memorial Mining Building. More information about each committee can be found below.</p>

The committee’s goal is to provide a platform for students in STEM and the broader campus community to interact with international and domestic policy issues. 
              <br/><br/>
              This semester, we will focus on the implications of the 2020 elections, the COVID-19 pandemic, Identity politics, and the widening ideology gap in the United States. Under the advocacy committee, you will have the opportunity to hold events, learn about lobbying, and engage in public and individual advocacy. In previous semesters, we have collaborated with Vote co. to increase voter engagement, participated in a congressional outreach program in DC,  held workshops to educate voters about policies such as the propositions, raised awareness about campus climate, and published policy spotlights. This semester, our tasks will entail running a Women in Policy speaker series, civic awareness workshops, and collaborating with campus organizations to raise awareness about pressing issues in policy.

              The Mentorship Committee will help the Liaison organize Mentor/Mentee Kickoffs, guide the mentees to make productive use of all mentor sessions, and foster a attitude of communal growth. Mentorship hosts both the professional Mentorship and the SWEster program, and thus committee members will be responsible for managing the logistics, publicity, and personal relations of each event. You'll be emailing dozens of professional women in the Bay Area, and this is a fantastic opportunity to expand your network and learn more about what engineering looks like from your peers and beyond. If you're interested in supporting women in engineering, you're in the right place!

Transfer students often come with their own stories, so our mission is to help immerse transfer students into Berkeley, but also enrich Cal with their experiences. This semester, we hope to start an affiliated SWE section in a community college, as well as host events for the admitted transfer class of 2021. No experience required and you don't need to be a transfer student to apply--definitely looking for apprentices who will bring their unique and diverse ideas and perspectives!

This is a wonderful opportunity if you have been positively affected by OHP yourself and/or are looking for a way to give back to the community that made you feel a part of the College of Engineering your freshman year. We look forward to meeting you and working with you as part of the SWE OHP committee.

Consider joining the PR Committee if you have an interest in design, communications, or anything public relations related! Experience with Adobe Illustrator or other relevant tools is preferred but not at all required.

              Team Tech is a national competition run by SWE and sponsored by Boeing in which a team at school works with an industry partner on a project. The company and project is of each team’s choosing. Teams are evaluated both on the end product quality and the ability of the team to work together. Project proposals may be submitted during the fall semester after which teams may begin their work. The final report is due at the end of the spring semester, and the presentations occur at the SWE fall conference.

              SWE Science is a hands-on engineering program held from 10AM to 11:30AM on Saturday mornings. The program is divided into two sections: SWE Science Saturdays for 4th-5th grade and SWE Science Scholars for 6th-8th grade students. During these sessions, students will engage in engineering challenges designed to allow students to not only practice foundational STEM principles but also to develop their intellectual curiosities and creativity. Previous activities have included cardboard vehicles, flotation devices, and plastic parachutes. If you are interested in planning and volunteering for our events this semester, please reach out!

The Intersocietal Apprentice and Intersocietal Chair will work together to foster an attitude of communal growth and work to maintain SWE’s social presence in the engineering community. Some events that the apprentice will be responsible for planning with the Chair will include the Professor’s Lunch, an intersocietal trivia night, and other fun intersocietal events, such as a potential DIY Boba Bar!  This apprenticeship will be a great way to obtain invaluable event planning experience, while having fun and meeting fellow engineers, as well!
