      <p class="text-center">For students, the best way to get involved in SWE at UC Berkeley is to become a general member, join a committee, or become an apprentice. In addition, we have a variety of social and professional events we host for students, as well as volunteering opportunities. Every month, we have a general meeting which is open to all students which serves as a great way to meet the officers and learn more about the SWE community. Officer positions open at the end of each semester for those who are interested in applying.</p>

              The Overnight Host Program Committee (OHP) is responsible for overseeing two, single day-long events (one online and one in-person) prior to CalDay that gives incoming non-male engineers their first experience as UC Berkeley Engineer. Responsibilities range from inviting professors to events, matching pen pals between admitted and current engineering students, designing admit packages to be shipped and organizing online and in-person activities for incoming admits! This is a wonderful opportunity if you have been positively affected by OHP yourself and/or are looking for a way to give back to the community that made you feel a part of the College of Engineering during your freshman year. We look forward to meeting you and working with you as part of the SWE OHP committee.

              Join SWE's web committee to help out with updating and maintaining our website, membership database, and hosting our SWE podcast! Our work will mainly consist of HTML, CSS, React.js, JavaScript, and Bootstrap elements. This semester we will be building the new SWE website so it'll be a great learning opportunity if you're interested in web development. Little to no experience is totally okay, but willingness to learn is emphasized and everyone is encouraged to apply!

              Team Tech is a national competition run by SWE and sponsored by Boeing in which a team of student engineers works with an industry partner on a year-long project. The project typically centers around finding and creating a solution using engineering processes for a problem posed by the company. As a Team Tech committee member, you will be exposed to a variety of soft and technical skills through industry experience, ranging from software development to core hardware engineering. We are looking for enthusiastic and committed members to join our team for the whole school year. For our team, we want a variety of technical experience levels, so whether you are very experienced or a passionate beginner, please apply! Note: There will be a short interview for Team Tech if selected as a finalist.

This semester, there will be 2 apprentice positions open for dedicated students who are interested in helping to put together our program by directly communicating with companies, working on student relations, and helping publicize the program. In addition, these apprentices would have the option to participate in an externship program, and they will also contribute to a blog post towards the end of the semester.

              SWE Science Saturdays [Grades 4-5] and SWE Science Scholars [Grades 6-8] are free, monthly programs conducted by UC Berkeley STEM students geared towards teaching young students the fundamentals of science and engineering through hands-on activities and experiments supplemented by presentations and workshops on scientific concepts. During this program, students of all genders will have the opportunity to complete various hands-on STEM activities and experiments while improving their STEM foundation and building on their existing knowledge. This semester, we are planning and hosting in-person events on September 9th, October 7th, November 4th, and December 2nd from 10 am - 12:30 pm. 
              <br><br>
              Some examples of previous experiments we have conducted are Marble Roller Coasters, Aerodynamic Models for Airplanes, Rubber-Band Powered Boat, Strawberry DNA Extraction, and Creating a Battery using Cents.

              The High School Engineering Program aspires to foster a nurturing environment for female and nonbinary high school students to learn about and explore their interests in engineering. Our 10-week program takes place every Saturday, from 9 AM to 12 PM, from September 9th to November 18th, with one week of break in the middle (date TBD). Mentors will begin working with us around the 3-week mark (September 23rd) and come in during sessions at the 5-week mark (October 7th) to help lead a technical project of their choice with a group of 4-6 high school students. 
              <br><br>
              The technical project will be designed and facilitated by mentors, with the final few sessions of HSEP being dedicated to working on the project and preparing for the Final Showcase. This is a great chance for you to educate high school students on your field or academic interests. You’ll be in charge of splitting up the work, guiding students through the process, and generally stepping into a mentor role. There are no creative limitations, and we will work with you to make sure your vision for the project can become a reality.

              Engineering Day is a Halloween-themed carnival-style event designed to encourage young elementary school children (K - 3rd grade) in the Bay Area to learn about STEM and participate in various themed booth activities. Our one-day program will take place on November 4th from 10 AM to 12 PM. Attendees will have the opportunity to complete hands-on STEM experiments, talk to “real” engineers, participate in lightning talks, and have fun with some arts and crafts!

            The Intersocietal and Membership Committees work closely together planning events for the SWE community and collaborating with other engineering organizations. By joining these committees, you get to meet new people and host social events that include: breakfasts, destress events, holiday-related events, game nights, banquets, and many others. You also have the chance to create new events for our community and others to enjoy!

          Our alumni go on to successful careers in all fields of engineering, and become role models and mentors for current undergraduate students. Alumni can stay in touch with UCB SWE through our alumni newsletter, our <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6944499/">LinkedIn presence</a></strong>, and more. Alumni near Berkeley are also invited to the several alumni socials we hold each semester. In addition, many alumni choose to stay involved with the national Society of Women Engineers as professional members.
