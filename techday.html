        <h5><br>Project Showcase</h5>
        <h6>
        Submitting a project is not required, but highly encouraged for students to participate in. If you submit a project and are accepted to the program, you will have the opportunity to present your project to students, parents, volunteers, and professors in a project showcase. We are offering project support through virtual project workshops and office hours (more information about our workshops can be found in the description of this form). 
        </h6>
        <h6>
            The goal of the project is to explore technology. Design something new that solves a problem you experience OR fascinates you. This can be a new object, tool, algorithm, robot, etc. You may write, design, and/or build your invention. Your final product should be a poster board (or another media of presentation) containing a description of what you designed, the problem you are trying to solve, your design process, your final product, and the next steps (if you had more time, how would you improve?). If you have a physical object/prototype you built, you may bring that in addition to your poster board. 
        </h6>
        <h6>
        <strong><u>We will be giving awards and prizes in the following project categories!</u></strong>
        <br>
        - <strong>Innovation Award</strong>: Given to a project that demonstrate unique and groundbreaking ideas or approaches.

            <u>If I register, am I guaranteed a spot in the program?</u>
            <br>
            As much as we would love to accept all students who apply, we, unfortunately, don't have the capacity and budget to accommodate more than ~60 students. 
            <br><br>
            <u>Do I need to have previous coding or technology experience? </u>
            <br>
            No! We are looking for passion, interest, and love for learning more about technology and computer science. We understand students may not have access to resources to explore technology, which is why we are offering this tech day as a space for students to explore technology for free!
            <br><br>
            <u>Where is the event located?</u>
            <br>
            The location of the event is UC Berkeley campus. Specific venue address and information will be emailed out to applicants who are accepted.
            <br><br>
            <u>Does the teacher or parent stay with the student throughout the conference, or do they drop off and pick up students before and after the conference?</u>
            <br>
            We require the teacher or parent to drop off their student and pick them up in the afternoon.
            <br><br>
            <u>Are parents allowed to stay with students throughout the conference?</u>
            <br>
            Due to logistical reasons, parents are not allowed to accompany their student throughout the conference. However, if there is a specific reason why the teacher or parent must stay with their student, we can discuss and accommodate the student on a case-by-case basis. Please email <strong><a href="mailto:swe.techday@gmail.com!" target="_">swe.techday@gmail.com</a></strong> to request for accommodations.
